## Unreleased

### Enhancements

- Dataviews: Make header table view select all checkbox always visible. ([#72050](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72050))
- Move search icon in search fields to prefix position ([#71984](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71984)).
- Flip search icons depending on placement ([#72070](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72070)).
- DataViews: Improve renderItemLink event propagation handling. ([#72081](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72081)).
- Normalize search field styles ([#72072](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72072)).

### Breaking changes

- DataForm: Add summary field support for both card and panel layouts. The `summary` property has been moved from the field level to the layout level, and so fields using `summary` at the field level must now configure it within the `layout` object. Additionally, the first children will only be used as summary for the panel if 1) there is no `layout.summary` and 2) the form field ID doesn't match any existing field. See README for details. [#71576](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71576)
- Remove `Data< Item >` type, as it is no longer used internally for a long time. [#72051](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72051)

### Features

- DataForm: add a style prop to set the width of elements in the row layout. [#72066](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72066)

### Code Quality

- Moves `utils.ts` to `field-types/utils/render-from-elements.ts`, so it's collocated where it is used. [#72058](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72058)
- Centralize all top-level utilities in a `utils/` folder, sets a name that reflects on the function name, and uses the default exports. [#72063](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/72063)

### Breaking changes

- DataForm: introduce a new `card` layout. The `form.type` has been moved under a new `layout` object and it is now `form.layout.type`, check the README for details. [#71100](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71100)
- Adds a new `config` prop to DataViews that allows hiding the view config control entirely. The `perPageSizes` prop has been moved to be part of this new prop. [#71173](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71173)

### Features

## 6.0.0 (2025-08-07)

### Breaking changes

- Field API: `isValid` is now an object that contains `required` and `custom` validation rules. Additionally, fields should now opt-in into being a "required" field by setting `isValid.required` to `true` (all fields of type `email` and `integer` were required by default). [#70901](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/70901)

- Fix `filterSortAndPaginate` to handle searching fields that have a type of `array` ([#70785](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/70785)).
- Fix user-input filters: empty value for text and integer filters means there's no value to search for (so it returns all items). It also fixes a type conversion where empty strings for integer were converted to 0 [#70956](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/70956/).
- Fix Table layout Title's column wrapping and min-width so that long descriptions can be visualized without scrolling. [#70983](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/70983)

- Fix the background color of the action column if the row is selected

### Features

- Add support for grouping items by a field in the `grid` layout by introducing a `groupByField` prop in the View object.
- Add support for free composition in the `DataViews` component by exporting subcomponents: `<DataViews.ViewConfig />`, `<DataViews.Search />`, `<DataViews.Pagination />`, `<DataViews.LayoutSwitcher />`, `<DataViews.Layout />`, `<DataViews.FiltersToggle />`, `<DataViews.Filters />`, `<DataViews.BulkActionToolbar />`.
- `select`, `text`, `email` controls: add `help` support from the field `description` prop.

- Add new `media`, `boolean`, `email`, `array` and `date` field type definitions.
- Field type definitions are now able to define a default `enableSorting` and `render` function.
- Pin the actions column on the table view when the width is insufficient.
- Enhance filter component styles.
- Add user input filter support based on the `Edit` property of the field type definitions.
- Add new filter operators: `lessThan`, `greaterThan`, `lessThanOrEqual`, `greaterThanOrEqual`, `contains`, `notContains`, `startsWith`, `between`, `on`, `notOn`, `before`, `after`, `inThePast`, `over`, `beforeInc`, and `afterInc`.
- Add `align` to the `layout.styles` properties, for use in the DataViews table layout. Options are: `start`, `center`, and `end`.
- Allow fields to opt-out of filtering via `field.filterBy: false`.
- Update the field type definitions to declare the default and valid operators they support. Fields with no `type` property can use all operators; if none is provided in the field's config, they'll use `is` and `isNot` by default.
- Adjust the spacing of the `DataForm` based on the type.
- Add `label-position-side` classes to labels in the form field layouts. Ensure that labels in the panel view do not align center, and that all side labels are center aligned.
- Allow readonly fields in DataForm when `readOnly` is set to `true`.
- Adjust the padding when the component is placed inside a `Card`.
- Introduce `perPageSizes` to control the available sizes of the items per page.
- Align media styles in table view with list view for consistency.

### Breaking Changes

- Fields with `Edit` defined or `type` will automatically be considered as filters unless `filterBy` is set to `false`.
- Add `renderItemLink` prop support in the `DataViews` component. It replaces `onClickItem`prop and allows integration with router libraries.

### Internal

- Adds new story that combines DataViews and DataForm.
- Add a story for each FieldTypeDefinition.

### Features

## 4.10.0 (2024-12-11)

### Breaking Changes

-   Support showing or hiding title, media and description fields ([#67477](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67477)).
-   Unify the `title`, `media` and `description` fields for the different layouts. So instead of the previous `view.layout.mediaField`, `view.layout.primaryField` and `view.layout.columnFields`, all the layouts now support these three fields with the following config ([#67477](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/67477)):

```js

## 4.5.0 (2024-10-03)

## 4.4.0 (2024-09-19)

## 4.3.0 (2024-09-05)

## Internal

-   The "move left/move right" controls in the table layout (popup displayed on cliking header) are always visible. ([#64646](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/64646)). Before this, its visibility depending on filters, enableSorting, and enableHiding.
-   Filters no longer display the elements' description. ([#64674](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/64674))

## Enhancements

-   Adjust layout of filter / actions row, increase width of search control when the container is narrower. ([#64681](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/64681)).

-   Variables like `process.env.IS_GUTENBERG_PLUGIN` have been replaced by `globalThis.IS_GUTENBERG_PLUGIN`. Build systems using `process.env` should be updated ([#61486](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/61486)).
-   Increase the minimum required Node.js version to v18.12.0 matching long-term support releases ([#31270](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/61930)). Learn more about [Node.js releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).

### Internal

### Breaking Changes

-   Removed the `onDetailsChange` event only available for the list layout. We are looking into adding actions to the list layout, including primary ones.

## 0.9.0 (2024-04-03)

### Enhancements

-   The `enumeration` type has been removed and we'll introduce new field types soon. The existing filters will still work as before given they checked for field.elements, which is still a condition filters should have.

## 0.8.0 (2024-03-21)

### Enhancements

-   Two new operators have been added: `isAll` and `isNotAll`. These are meant to represent `AND` operations. For example, `Category is all: Book, Review, Science Fiction` would represent all items that have all three categories selected.
-   DataViews now supports multi-selection. A new set of filter operators has been introduced: `is`, `isNot`, `isAny`, `isNone`. Single-selection operators are `is` and `isNot`, and multi-selection operators are `isAny` and `isNone`. If no operators are declared for a filter, it will support multi-selection. Additionally, the old filter operators `in` and `notIn` operators have been deprecated and will work as `is` and `isNot` respectively. Please, migrate to the new operators as they'll be removed soon.

### Breaking Changes

-   Removed the `getPaginationResults` and `sortByTextFields` utils and replaced them with a unique `filterSortAndPaginate` function.
